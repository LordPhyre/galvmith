Minetest Mod based around Mithril from moreores

I hope you add the mod BoiNatu lmao. The textures are really similar to regular mithril, but I want it that way.
The tools are exactly the same, but just more durable. (4 times as much to be exact.)

The armor gives just a tiny bit more protection, but the only major difference is, as I said, the durability. (Which is now 5x)
